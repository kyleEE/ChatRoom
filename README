Design Decisions & Issues
-------------------------
1. Client Class Hierachy:
Client---ClientGUI---LogPanel, ChatPanel, TypePanel, ListPanel
- class Client handles the communications to server.
- class ClientGUI manages four panels, pass the user input to class Client and messages from server to ChatPanel to display.

2. Server's job
Server will broadcast every message it receives, deciding wether or not the message should be display is the client's job.
